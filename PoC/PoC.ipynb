      "概要: <div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">For any organization that has invested in an internal developer platform, a question inevitably arises: Is it actually working? </span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">Simply tracking adoption rates won't tell you if your platform is truly delivering value to your developers. This was the challenge faced by John Lewis, a major UK retailer. In our previous articles (parts </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/simplifying-platform-engineering-at-john-lewis-part-one\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">1</span></a><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/simplifying-platform-engineering-at-john-lewis-part-two\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">2</span></a><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">) we introduced the John Lewis Digital Platform (JLDP) and how it enabled dozens of product teams to build high-quality software rapidly to power www.johnlewis.com and other critical applications. But how did they know that the platform was actually successful? Traditional product metrics like revenue and sales don’t translate easily to this world. When you focus only on whether your tenants use the platform, you don’t understand whether it’s bringing them value.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">In this article, Alex Moss from the John Lewis platform team discusses how they moved beyond simple usage metrics to develop a sophisticated, multi-stage approach to measuring the real value of their platform — a journey that took them from lead-time metrics, to </span><a href=\"https://dora.dev/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">DORA</span></a><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">, and finally to a \"Technical Health\" score. Along the way, they explore how the JLDP’s purpose evolved — and its value along with it. - Darren Evans</span></p>\n",
      "<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Initial measurement: A focus on platform value</strong></h3>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In the early days of the platform, understanding its value was actually much easier. This was because the platform was created with a very clear purpose: to enable speed of change. The John Lewis business wanted to create multiple product teams working on several features of johnlewis.com in parallel, and to put those features in front of customers quickly for feedback.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Its origins in the world of the company’s John Lewis Digital online business resulted in it being treated as a product from a very early stage, and therefore integrated with that area’s reporting mechanisms too. Thus, it became normal to link the platform objectives to the online business’s broader goals each quarter and report on measurable key results. This kept the focus on the reasons the platform is important: do improvements to the platform continue to justify using it over seeking out a different one? We cannot afford to rest on our laurels!</span></p></div>\n",

      "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This was then combined with the number of tenants present on the platform into a report, which was displayed as part of an initial home-grown Service Catalogue shown above (which was later </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/john-lewis-software-engineering/weve-gone-backstage-this-is-how-we-use-it-on-our-digital-platform-b299cd4acb24\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">replaced with Backstage</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">). This report served two purposes:</span></p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A very clear visualization for stakeholders of how much their platform was being adopted, and how fast they were able to get up and running (in particular, “Service Creation” being measured in single-digit hours, in comparison to the weeks teams would traditionally have had to wait). This is important, because in the early days of your product, you need to justify its continued growth and investment.</span></p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A useful way for the platform team themselves (and stakeholders) to see which teams were taking their time about getting something into production. Is my product actually helping you? And if not, what more could we be doing?</span></p>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Using this as a conversation-starter with our tenants opened doors to rich sources of feedback that could be turned into platform features: When we asked tenants “What’s stopping you from going live?”, they often answered that the product they were building was simply complex. But we also often saw that our own processes were getting in the way. This was important, as we could then do something about it.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The easiest of these barriers for us to overcome were typically technology-related. In </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/simplifying-platform-engineering-at-john-lewis-part-one\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">previous articles</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, we covered two examples, “My team is spending a lot of time writing Terraform to provision PubSub,” and “we’re having trouble learning how to use Kubernetes.” To help, the platform team created “paved roads” to enable self-service provisioning or simplification of Kubernetes, significantly reducing these burdens for teams.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The more significant opportunities to streamline getting new services live were a result of our processes (e.g., security approvals) — and if your platform is empowered to simplify these sorts of organizational functions, then the gains can be extremely beneficial. One such example was the Information Security risk assurance process. Gaining the necessary security sign-offs and producing the required documentation was a necessary but time-consuming task, and - with the rate of change in the business - this was often something that many teams were going through in parallel. Our platform team successfully negotiated a simplified process for its tenants. It was able to do this because, by being resident on the platform, they could guarantee that security controls were in place and that policies were being followed. This was a direct result of the platform building features to meet those needs, and being able to provide evidence that they were being used — removing the need for the tenant team to either document or invent this themselves. This is still simplifying the developer experience through platform engineering, even though the solution is a less technically-based one.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Sometimes the conversation resulted in feedback that wasn’t even platform-shaped — for example, helping teams understand concepts like feature flagging and dark launching, or software design options to help break dependencies with legacy systems. John Lewis’ platform teams are staffed with experienced engineers, ideally ones with software development experience, which helps a lot with these sorts of interactions.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A key point here is that by measuring how effectively teams were making it into production, we could identify who to talk to and elucidate the feedback we needed on what problems needed to be addressed. Simply relying on your tenants thinking of this themselves when they don’t see the bigger picture (or have other priorities) is not nearly as effective.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">We then combined the process with more traditional approaches such as sending out a survey or use of Net Promoter Scoring to help build popularity in the product. The results of these were usually very positive, and could be used to generate mindshare — especially where a product team was comfortable talking about their positive experiences in internal tech conferences and the like.</span></p>\n",
      "<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Helping understand team performance</strong></h3>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A few years into the life of the platform, our emphasis started to shift. There was less of a need to prove the value of the platform — the business and our engineers were happy — so we shifted from “how can we get you into production as quickly as possible” towards “how can we enable you to continue to be as fast, but also reduce friction, in your day-to-day activities.” This led us towards DORA metrics.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Our initial DORA implementations involved mining information from our systems of record for change and incident, complimented by our already-mature observability stack for availability data, as well as pulling events from things like cloud audit logs. We built software to do this and stored it in BigQuery, which enabled us to visualize the data in our home-grown Service Catalogue tool. Later, we moved this into Grafana dashboards instead, which are still in use today:</span></p></div>\n",

      "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Looking for patterns in this data led to us discovering additional features that would be useful for us to build. Two major examples of this were </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">handling change</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, and </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">operational readiness</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">JLP’s service management processes were geared towards handling complex release processes across multiple large systems and/or teams - but we had fundamentally changed our architecture by adopting microservices. This empowered teams to release independently at will, and therefore manage the consequences of failed changes themselves. We used the data we’d collected about change failure rates and frequency of small releases to justify a different approach: allowing tenants to automatically raise and close changes as part of their CI/CD pipelines. After clearing this approach with our Service Management team, we developed a CLI tool that teams could use within their pipelines. This had the additional benefit of allowing us to capture useful data at point of release, rather than scraping more awkward data sources. The automated change “carrot” was very popular and was widely adopted, shifting the approval point left to the pull request rather than later in the release process. This reduced time wastage, change-set size and risk of collisions.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In a similar vein, with more teams operating their own services, the need for a central site-wide operations team was reduced. We could see from our metrics that teams practicing “You Build It, You Run It” had fewer incidents and were resolving them much more quickly. We used this as evidence to bring in tooling to help them respond to incidents faster, and decouple the centralized ops teams from those processes — in some cases allowing them to focus on legacy systems, and in others, removing the need for the service entirely (which resulted in significant cost savings, despite the fact that we had more individual product teams on-call). This, and supporting observability and alerting tooling, was all configured through the platform’s paved-road pipeline described in our </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/simplifying-platform-engineering-at-john-lewis-part-one\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">previous article</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The DORA metrics helped us architecturally as well. Operational data shined a light on the brittleness of third-party and legacy services, thereby driving greater investment into resilience engineering, alternative solutions, and in some cases, causing us to re-evaluate our build vs. buy decisions. </span></p>\n",
      "<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Choosing what to measure</strong></h3>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">It’s very important to choose wisely about what to measure. Experts in the field (such as </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trO_fiTAZeM\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Laura Tacho</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">) influenced us to avoid vanity metrics and to be cautious about interpreting the ones we do collect. It’s also important for metrics to be meaningful to the target audience, and presented accordingly.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As an example, we communicate about cost and vulnerability with our teams, but the form this takes depends on the intended audience’s role. For example, we send new vulnerabilities or spikes in cost directly to product teams’ collaboration channels, because experience has taught us that having our engineers see these vulnerabilities results in a faster response. On the other hand, for compliance reporting or review by team leads, reports are more effective at summarising the areas that need action. Because if we know one thing, it’s that nobody wants to be a leader of the “vulnerabilities outside of policy” dashboard!</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">It was not unusual for us to historically look at measures such as the number or frequency of incidents. But in a world of highly automated response systems, this is a trap, as alerts can be easily duplicated. Focusing too much on a number can drive the wrong behavior — at worst, deliberately avoiding creating an incident at all! Instead, it’s much better to focus on the impact of the parent incident and how long it took to recover. Another example is reporting on the number of vulnerabilities. Imagine you have a package that is used extensively across many components in a distributed system. Disclosing that the package has a vulnerability can create a false sense of scale, when in fact patching the base image deals with the problem swiftly. Instead, it’s better to look at the speed of response than a pre-agreed policy based on severity. This is both a much more effective and reasonable metric for teams to act on, so we see better engagement.</span></p>\n",
      "<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">It’s very important that you put across as much context as possible when presenting the data so that the right conclusions can be drawn — especially where those reports are seen by decision-makers. With that in mind, we combined raw metrics we could visualize with user opinion about them. This helped to bring that missing context: Is the team that’s suffering from a high change failure rate also struggling with its release processes and batch size? Is the team that’s not addressing vulnerabilities quickly also reporting that they’re spending too much time on feature development and not enough on operational matters? We reached for a different tool — </span><a href=\"https://getdx.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">DX</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> — to help us bring this sort of information to bear.

      "DEユニットのカルチャーを一言で表すなら、「研究室の延長」のような雰囲気です。落ち着いた雰囲気のメンバーが多く、また、皆さん技術への興味が非常に高いです。新しい技術を自ら積極的に学び、それを会社全体で共有する文化が根付いていると思っています。Slackでの技術情報の共有はもちろん、各自がテーマを設定して勉強会を開き、興味のあるメンバーが集まって議論することも日常的に行われています。</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #286f2c;\">斉藤 </span></strong> <br />\n",
      "私もそう思います。加えて、私たちDEユニットには「Skill-Up Day」というユニークな取り組みもしています。</p><p><span><img class=\"hatena-fotolife\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/b/bpblog-igarashi/20260120/20260120114756.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"1200\" /></span></p><p><strong>──Skill-Up Dayとは、具体的にどのような活動なのでしょうか？</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #286f2c;\">斉藤 </span></strong><br />\n",
      "毎月1日を「Skill-Up Day」と名付け、案件以外の時間を使い、各自が自由に技術について調査・学習する日としています。特にテーマは設定せず、新しい技術に触れ、社内向けのナレッジとしてまとめたり、LT（ライトニングトーク）形式で部門メンバーに共有したりしています。この自由度の高さが、技術探求を後押ししていると思います。</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #dd830c;\">井出</span></strong> <br />\n",
      "最近のSkill-Up Dayでは、AIやLLM（大規模言語モデル）に関する話題が多いです。プロジェクトでの活用事例といった深掘りしたテーマから、画面開発やAIを活用したコーディング支援など、幅広いテーマが議論されています。単なる技術共有に留まらず、それを実際のプロジェクトや業務にどう落とし込んでいくか、という視点まで踏み込むことが多いのがDEユニットの特徴だと思います。</p><p><strong>──素晴らしいですね！一方で、クライアントワーク中心のDEユニットのビジネスにおいて、Skill-Up Dayのような「投資」をどのように捉えていますか？</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #1464b3;\">石母田</span></strong><br />\n",
      "非常に重要な視点ですね。クライアントの要求に応えることが第一ですが、一方でエンジニアとしてスキルアップは不可欠です。お客さまからまだ要求されていない領域についても、いつそれが需要や要望として顕在化するか分からないため、常にアンテナを張り、目の前の案件以外の技術も身につけておく必要があります。</p><p>また、上司が「これをやりなさい」と指示するだけでは限界があります。やはり技術に最も近いのは現場のエンジニアであり、現場のエンジニアが自律的に技術を探求し、それをビジネスに繋げようと意識しながら活動してくれるのは、マネジメント層として非常にありがたいです。</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #286f2c;\">斉藤 </span></strong><br />\n",
      "このようなコミュニケーションの機会がないと、案件ごとに技術知見が閉じてしまう状態になりがちです。異なる案件に携わる社員が集まって技術的な共有を行うことは、ブレインパッドのエンジニア組織のケイパビリティ拡張や、長期的な成長に不可欠だと考えています。</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #1464b3;\">石母田</span></strong><br />\n",
      "エンジニアのモチベーションは、「言われたことを頑張る」だけでは維持できません。世の中には多様な技術的なチャレンジの機会がありますし、業務以外にもこうした取り組みがあることで、そこに価値やモチベーションを見出すエンジニアは多いのではないでしょうか。そして、結果的にクライアントへの価値提供にもつながると考えています。</p><p><span><img class=\"hatena-fotolife\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/b/bpblog-igarashi/20260120/20260120122151.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"1200\" /></span><br />\n",

      "    <p>社内での活発な知識共有に加え、DEユニットは社外への情報発信にも力を入れています。その中心となるのが、定期開催されている勉強会「DEU Tech Drive」です。</p><p><strong>──この勉強会を定期開催するに至った背景や経緯について教えてください。</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #1464b3;\">石母田</span></strong><br />\n",
      "クライアントとの関係性や、社内だけの関係性だけを意識するだけではなく、新たな関係性を構築したり、情報収集をしたり、発信をしようという取り組みをしていこうという方針が立てられました。それに基づいて、DEユニットとして何をどうやって発信していくかを考えたのが始まりです。ブレインパッドは「データサイエンティストの会社」というイメージが強い中で、DEユニットの存在感を社外にもっと出していく必要があると感じていました。当初は他社主催の勉強会に登壇する形で試行錯誤しましたが、他社のプラットフォームで定期的に発信し続けるのは難しいと感じました。そこで、ブレインパッドのconnpassアカウントを活用し、「月1回は必ず発信する」というルールを設けて、現在の勉強会を開催することとなりました。</p><p><strong>──マネジメント層からそうした話があった時、井出さんや斉藤さんはどのように受け止めましたか？</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #dd830c;\">井出</span></strong> <br />\n",
      "私もブレインパッドの見え方については、同じ認識をしており、DEユニットの特徴や強みが社外に十分に発信できていないという課題感は持っていました。社外発信をしたいメンバーはいるものの、その機会が不足しているとも感じていたので、この取り組みに非常に賛同しました。現在は強制ではなく、自ら発信したいメンバーを募って開催していますが、それがうまく機能していると感じています。特にMLE（機械学習エンジニア）のメンバーは、声をかけるとすぐに手を挙げてくれるので、本当に心強いです。</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #286f2c;\">斉藤 </span></strong><br />\n",
      "私も全く否定的な感情はなく、むしろ「絶対にやるべきだ」と思いました。DEユニットではデータやAIを中心とした多様な技術背景を持つメンバーがおり、日々多様な案件に取り組んでいます。テーマを限定せずに、技術的な発信をすることで、DEユニットにどんなエンジニアがいるのかということを、ありのまま伝えていける場があるというのは、非常に有意義だと考えています。</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #1464b3;\">石母田</span></strong><br />\n",
      "テーマを絞りすぎると、発表できる内容が限られてしまうという懸念がありました。まずは、「テーマは自由で、社外に向けて発信して良い発表であれば何でもOK」というスタンスで、回数を重ねて実績を積むことを優先しています。</p><p><strong>──これまでの勉強会では、どのようなテーマが発表されてきましたか？</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #dd830c;\">井出</span></strong> <br />\n",
      "大きく分けると、生成AIや最新トレンド技術に関するテーマと、クラウドインフラやMLOps、開発手法や品質、マインドセットといったテーマが多いです。いずれも、ドキュメントレベルの紹介に留まらず、実際に使ってみた感想や仕組みの裏側の、コスト面まで踏み込んだ話をすることを意識しています。</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #1464b3;\">石母田</span></strong><br />\n",
      "一般的に公開されている技術情報だけでは、わざわざ勉強会で聞くまでもないと思われてしまう。だからこそ「やってみた結果どうだったか」という、手触り感のあるリアルな情報が重要だと感じています。成功談だけでなく、「こうしたらダメだった」「ダメだった時にどうしたか」といった失敗談こそ、エンジニアが本当に知りたい情報ですよね。</p><p><span><img class=\"hatena-fotolife\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/b/bpblog-igarashi/20260120/20260120122245.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"1200\" /></span></p><p><strong>──斉藤さんは、新卒1年目のタイミングでイベントに登壇されましたね。どのような経緯で登壇されたのでしょうか？</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #286f2c;\">斉藤 </span></strong> <br />\n",

      "DEユニットが社外発信の文化を作ろうとしている取り組みを知っていたので、そこに貢献できる機会であれば断る理由はないと思いました。技術的な交流をしたいという気持ちと、組織的な課題意識もあり、参加にはとても前向きでした。</p><p><strong>──斉藤さんの登壇テーマと、その狙いを教えてください。</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #286f2c;\">斉藤 </span></strong> <br />\n",
      "私は「生成AIを活用したコーディングにおいて、生成されたコードの品質をどう評価し、維持していくか」というテーマで話しました。過去の勉強会では案件で使っている技術の話が多かったので、自分自身の視点から、学生の方や若手エンジニアが興味を持ちやすいような、聞きに来やすいテーマを意識しました。なので、タイトルにも「新卒1年目が考える」と付けたりして、ブレインパッドで若手エンジニアがどう学び、どう考えながら開発しているのかを伝えたいと考えました。</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #dd830c;\">井出</span></strong> <br />\n",
      "生成AIとの向き合い方というテーマは、新卒に限らず全員にとって非常に重要なテーマだと思います。社内の人にとっては改めて向き合い方を考える機会になり、社外の人、特にブレインパッドに興味がある方にとっては、現場でどのように向き合っているかを知る良い機会になったと感じています。</p><p>※斉藤さん登壇資料はこちらからご確認ください！<br />\n",

      "Accurate weather forecasts can have a direct impact on people’s lives, from helping make routine decisions, like what to pack for a day’s activities, to informing urgent actions, for example, protecting people in the face of hazardous weather conditions. The importance of accurate and timely weather forecasts will only increase as the climate changes. Recognizing this, we at Google have been investing in weather and climate research to help ensure that the forecasting technology of tomorrow can meet the demand for reliable weather information. Some of our recent innovations include <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2023/11/metnet-3-state-of-art-neural-weather.html\">MetNet-3</a>, Google's high-resolution forecasts up to 24-hours into the future, and <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/\">GraphCast</a>, a weather model that can predict weather up to 10 days ahead.\n",

SEEDS is a generative AI model that can efficiently generate ensembles of weather forecasts <em>at scale </em>at a small fraction of the cost of traditional physics-based forecasting models.

      "\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "In December 1972, at the <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/\">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> meeting in Washington, D.C., MIT meteorology professor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz\">Ed Lorenz</a> gave a talk entitled, “Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?” which contributed to the term “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect\">butterfly effect</a>”. He was building on his earlier, landmark 1963 paper where he examined the feasibility of “very-long-range weather prediction” and described how errors in initial conditions grow exponentially when integrated in time with numerical weather prediction models. This exponential error growth, known as chaos, results in a deterministic predictability limit that restricts the use of individual forecasts in decision making, because they do not quantify the inherent uncertainty of weather conditions. This is particularly problematic when forecasting extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, or floods.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "Recognizing the limitations of deterministic forecasts, weather agencies around the world issue <em>probabilistic forecasts</em>. Such forecasts are based on ensembles of deterministic forecasts, each of which is generated by including synthetic noise in the initial conditions and stochasticity in the physical processes. Leveraging the fast error growth rate in weather models, the forecasts in an ensemble are purposefully different: the initial uncertainties are tuned to generate runs that are as different as possible and the stochastic processes in the weather model introduce additional differences during the model run. The error growth is mitigated by averaging all the forecasts in the ensemble and the variability in the ensemble of forecasts quantifies the uncertainty of the weather conditions.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "While effective, generating these probabilistic forecasts is computationally costly. They require running highly complex numerical weather models on massive supercomputers multiple times. Consequently, many operational weather forecasts can only afford to generate ~10–50 ensemble members for each forecast cycle. This is a problem for users concerned with the likelihood of rare but high-impact weather events, which typically require much larger ensembles to assess beyond a few days. For instance, one would need a 10,000-member ensemble to forecast the likelihood of events with 1% probability of occurrence with a relative error less than 10%. Quantifying the probability of such extreme events could be useful, for example, for emergency management preparation or for energy traders.\n",

      "<p>\n",
      "In the aforementioned <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4489\">paper</a>, we present the Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (SEEDS), a generative AI technology for weather forecast ensemble generation. SEEDS is based on <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2021/07/high-fidelity-image-generation-using.html\">denoising diffusion probabilistic</a> models, a state-of-the-art generative AI method pioneered in part by Google Research.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "SEEDS can generate a large ensemble conditioned on as few as one or two forecasts from an operational numerical weather prediction system. The generated ensembles not only yield plausible real-weather–like forecasts but also match or exceed physics-based ensembles in skill metrics such as the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26201352\">rank histogram</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation\">root-mean-squared error</a> (RMSE), and the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214506000001437\">continuous ranked probability score</a> (CRPS). In particular, the generated ensembles assign more accurate likelihoods to the tail of the forecast distribution, such as ±2σ and ±3σ weather events. Most importantly, the computational cost of the model is negligible when compared to the hours of computational time needed by supercomputers to make a forecast. It has a throughput of 256 ensemble members (at 2° resolution) per 3 minutes on Google Cloud TPUv3-32 instances and can easily scale to higher throughput by deploying more accelerators. \n",

      "<p>\n",
      "Generative AI is known to generate very detailed images and videos. This property is especially useful for generating ensemble forecasts that are consistent with plausible weather patterns, which ultimately result in the most added value for downstream applications.  As Lorenz points out, “The [weather forecast] maps which they produce should look like real weather maps.\" The figure below contrasts the forecasts from SEEDS to those from the operational U.S. weather prediction system (<a href=\"https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/numerical_forecast_systems/gefs.php\">Global Ensemble Forecast System</a>, GEFS) for a particular date during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_heatwaves\">2022 European heat waves</a>. We also compare the results to the forecasts from a Gaussian model that predicts the univariate mean and standard deviation of each atmospheric field at each location, a common and computationally efficient but less sophisticated data-driven approach. This Gaussian model is meant to characterize the output of pointwise post-processing, which ignores correlations and treats each grid point as an independent random variable. In contrast, a real weather map would have detailed <em>correlational</em> structures. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "Because SEEDS directly models the joint distribution of the atmospheric state, it realistically captures both the spatial covariance and the correlation between mid-tropospheric geopotential and mean sea level pressure, both of which are closely related and are commonly used by weather forecasters for evaluation and verification of forecasts. Gradients in the mean sea level pressure are what drive winds at the surface, while gradients in mid-tropospheric geopotential create upper-level winds that move large-scale weather patterns. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "The generated samples from SEEDS shown in the figure below (frames Ca–Ch) display a geopotential trough west of Portugal with spatial structure similar to that found in the operational U.S. forecasts or the reanalysis based on observations. Although the Gaussian model predicts the marginal univariate distributions adequately, it fails to capture cross-field or spatial correlations. This hinders the assessment of the effects that these anomalies may have on hot air intrusions from North Africa, which can exacerbate heat waves over Europe.\n",

Indeed, the event probability computed from a Gaussian kernel density estimate is lower than 1%, which means that ensembles with less than 100 members are unlikely to contain forecasts as extreme as this event. In contrast, the SEEDS ensembles are able to extrapolate from the two seeding forecasts, providing an envelope of possible weather states with much better statistical coverage of the event. This allows both quantifying the probability of the event taking place and sampling weather regimes under which it would occur. Specifically, our highly scalable generative approach enables the creation of very large ensembles that can characterize very rare events by providing samples of weather states exceeding a given threshold for any user-defined diagnostic.\n",

      "SEEDS leverages the power of generative AI to produce ensemble forecasts comparable to those from the operational U.S. forecast system, but at an accelerated pace. The results reported in this paper need only 2 seeding forecasts from the operational system, which generates 31 forecasts in its current version. This leads to a hybrid forecasting system where a few weather trajectories computed with a physics-based model are used to seed a diffusion model that can generate additional forecasts much more efficiently. This methodology provides an alternative to the current operational weather forecasting paradigm, where the computational resources saved by the statistical emulator could be allocated to increasing the resolution of the physics-based model or issuing forecasts more frequently.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "We believe that SEEDS represents just one of the many ways that AI will accelerate progress in operational numerical weather prediction in coming years. We hope this demonstration of the  utility of generative AI for weather forecast emulation and post-processing will spur its application in research areas such as climate risk assessment, where generating a large number of ensembles of climate projections is crucial to accurately quantifying the uncertainty about future climate.\n",
